- **Interest:** Is the topic likely to be interesting to a general audience, or the specified target audience (if provided)?
- **Specificity:** Is the topic specific enough to be covered well in a single blog post, but not too narrow?
- **Uniqueness:** Does it offer a fresh angle or perspective if the theme is common?
- **SEO Potential (Implicit):** Think about topics that people might be searching for, even if keywords aren't explicitly requested yet.

Output exactly {num_suggestions} topic suggestions.
Each suggestion should be a single, concise title or idea.
Present the suggestions as a numbered list, with each topic on a new line. For example:
1. Topic one
2. Topic two
3. Topic three
